This project implements a machine learning solution to classify whether an employee earns more than or less than $50,000 per year. The model is trained on the Adult Census Income dataset, leveraging key demographic and work-related features.

## Features
- Handles missing data and encodes categorical variables
- Scales numerical features
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Evaluates with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
- Shows feature importances (Random Forest)
- Saves the trained model for later use
